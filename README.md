# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple Tic-tac-toe clone.

The application plays a game of Tic-Tac-Toe between a human and the computer. The human can choose to play either through a GUI, or the command line, 
and the computer uses a predefined algorithm.

The dist folder contains an exe file of the script, enabling you to play it without downloading the third party libraries used.
